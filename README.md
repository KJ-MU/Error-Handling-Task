# Overview
Write a function called `divideNumbers` that accepts two numbers as arguments and returns the result of dividing the first number by the second number.  
The function should also handle the following errors:

- If either argument is not a number, throw an error with the message "Both arguments must be numbers".   
     You can use `typeof` to check if the current value is a number or not.   
     e.g: `typeof value === "number"`
- If the second argument is zero, throw an error with the message "Cannot divide by zero".
